# Breakeven

Breakeven is a custom MetaTrader script that moves stop-loss to breakeven for one or more trades. It was coded by EarnForex.com for MT4 and MT5.

Its main purpose is to provide a quick and easy way to set breakeven on multiple positions while implementing filters to control which positions to work with.
